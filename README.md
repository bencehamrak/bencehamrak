## About me
<p style="text-align:justify;">
I am a doctoral candidate at Central European University in Vienna. I study political behavior and public opinion via (quasi-) experiments. I look at the influence of salient events on group identities. Currently, I am examining the compound effect of elections on in- and out-party feelings, and the effect of football games on out-group animosity. My other projects look at the limits of citizen accountability on complex or controversial issues such as drug regulation or political scandals. My work has been published in the <em>British Journal of Political Science</em> and the <em>European Journal of Political Economy</em>. I am a serious hobby cyclist. My academic hobby is evolutionary biology and animal behavior.
